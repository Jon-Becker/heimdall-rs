## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). This code of conduct is a baseline for the behavior of all contributors.

## Types of Contributions

- ### Issues
  - Issues are a great way for anyone to contribute to the project. If you find a bug or have a feature request, please file an issue using one of the templates found [here](https://github.com/Jon-Becker/heimdall-rs/issues/new/choose).
  - Users can also contribute to the project by helping resolving issues, either through PRs or by commenting on issues.

  #### Stale Issues
    Issues that have been open with no activity for more than a month will be closed. Issues that are being worked on or are planned are exempt. Please make sure to keep your issue active until it is resolved or closed.

- ### Pull Requests
  - Another way to contribute to the project is by creating a pull request. This is a way for you to make changes to the codebase, and request that the changes be merged into the main branch.

    #### Types of Pull Requests
    - Bug Fixes
    - Adding new features
    - Adding Modules

    #### Getting Started
    1. Firstly, you'll need to create a new branch for your changes. You can do this by forking the repository, and then creating a new branch. Keep in mind this branch name should be descriptive of your changes.
    2.  Make your changes to the codebase, or add new features!
    3. When committing your changes, you'll need to add descriptive and specific commit messages. A good commit message is one that describes the changes you've made, and the reason for your changes.
        - For more information on commit messages, check out [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).

    #### Merging a Pull Request
    Once you're happy with your changes, you can open a PR to ask for permission to merge your changes into the main branch.

    When you open a PR, you'll be asked to provide a description of your changes. This description should be as detailed as possible, and should include an overview of the changes you've made, and the reason for your changes.

    After you've opened a PR, a community member will review your changes and approve them. If they approve your changes, they'll merge them into the main branch. If they don't approve your changes, they'll either close the PR or ask you to make changes to your codebase.

    #### Stale Pull Requests
    Pull requests that have been open with no activity for more than a month will be closed. Please make sure to keep your PR active until it is merged or closed
