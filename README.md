Heimdall is an advanced EVM toolkit which aims to make dealing with smart contracts on EVM based chains easier.

## Installation & Usage

Ensure that Rust & Cargo are installed:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Heimdall's update and installation manager, `bifrost`, can be installed using the following command:

```bash
curl -L http://get.heimdall.rs | bash
```

<!-- Alternatively, you can install through GitHub directly using the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jon-Becker/heimdall-rs/main/bifrost/install | bash
``` -->

If you want to manually install bifrost, you can download the latest release from [here](./bifrost/bifrost).

Once you have installed `bifrost`, you can use it to install Heimdall using the following command from a new terminal:

```bash
bifrost
```

After compilation, the `heimdall` command will be available to use from a new terminal. For advanced options, see the [bifrost documentation](https://jbecker.dev/r/heimdall-rs/wiki/installation).
